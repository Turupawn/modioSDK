# Sample projects

This directory contains a variety of sample projects helping you achieve the minimal configuration required to setup mod.io on different platforms. In every directory you will find a `Readme.md` file that assists you to setup, compile and run the projects and a `Makefile` showing the configuration needed. If you want a more detailed explanation please follow our [Getting Started](https://github.com/modio/SDK/wiki/Getting-Started) documentation.
